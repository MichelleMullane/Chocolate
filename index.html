        Chocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods,
        that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a
        flavoring agent in other foods. <br />

        Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec
        civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican
        people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.
